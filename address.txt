 -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
  -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
  -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom
  -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
  Abraham Lincoln
  November 19, 1863
