We're going to digress from Web development for a little bit & practice with something Python does really well:  text processing & parsing --- by building a program that makes a protein from DNA.

But if this  just _isn't for you_ -- you can always get your Python practice below through exercism.io instead.  Or even supplement this homework with exercism.io.

For enven more practice, go to exercism.io  (_you can use GitHub to login_), and work your way through the first 5 or so exercises.  You'll get some good practice in basic Python, have some automated tests of your code .... and get valuable feedback from volunteer mentors.  It's really a great place to learn...and who knows?  You might want to buckle down and do _**even more exercises**_ when you're through.
