    "\n",
    "The **Binomial distribution** is a _**superset**_ of the **Bernoulli distribution**. When we have to calculate the possibilities of **same event** occurring more than once we head towards a **binomial distribution** with the results. Here (_as with Bernoulli_) there are two possible outcomes (1 & 0) but every trial is **independent** of another in its probably outcome. A binomial distribution that only includes **one** trial is a **Bernoulli distribution**.\n",
